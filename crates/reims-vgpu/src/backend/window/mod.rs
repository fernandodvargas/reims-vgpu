//! The rail-neutral vocabulary of the host-owned presentation window
//! ([[host-window]]).
//!
//! The window is one native surface, one event loop and one aspect-fit
//! viewport, and none of those depend on which rail draws into it. What *is*
//! rail-specific is exactly three things: how a surface is created for the
//! native handle, what a GPU-resident frame is called, and why a present was
//! refused. This module names those three so that
//! [`crate::host_window::present`] can drive a presenter without ever
//! mentioning a rail, and [`super::Backend`] can carry them as ordinary trait
//! methods.
//!
//! Everything here is `host-window`-gated, which is the lawful question for a
//! `cfg`: whether this build compiled a window at all is a fact about the build.
//! Whether the *running* rail can fill one is [`super::Backend::presents_host_window`],
//! and it is a run-time answer — a `--backend both` binary compiles this module
//! for its Metal boot and its Vulkan boot alike.

/// Where a guest frame lands inside a window, and where a window position lands
/// inside a guest frame.
///
/// Here rather than beside the window, because both rails' presenters need it
/// and `backend` may not reach up into [`crate::host_window`] — a lower layer
/// importing from a higher one is how the two halves of "presentation and

/// The window reaches down for the same functions, which is the direction that
