//! Reims vGPU host path — single crate.
//!
//! | Module | Role |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`protocol`] | Stable facts: formats, layouts, pure arithmetic |
//! | [`model`] | Live guest-visible state (regs, rings, objects, present) |
//! | [`runtime`] | Drain / parse / resolve / plan / HostActions |
//! | [`backend`] | Trait + self-contained [`backend::metal`] / [`backend::vulkan`] |
//! | [`qemu`] | QEMU C ABI surface only |
//!
//! Features: at least one of `backend-metal` (default) or `backend-vulkan`, and
//! a build may carry **both**. Vulkan's product path is self-contained `ash`
//! ([`backend::vulkan::engine`]).
//!
//! # The supported arms
//!
//! | Arm | Features | Host GPU API |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Metal | `backend-metal` | native Metal |
//! | Vulkan / MoltenVK | `backend-vulkan` on macOS | MoltenVK |
//! | Vulkan / native | `backend-vulkan` on linux | native ICD |
//! | Both | `backend-metal,backend-vulkan` on macOS | either, chosen at run time |
//!
//! **Gate the host on `target_os` and nothing else.** `macos` and `linux` are
//! the only two values this crate names, so a reader greps one key to find
//! every host gate.
//!
//! There is **no** host-stub Metal arm. `backend-metal` off macOS has no Metal
//! to call, so it is a compile error rather than a binary that links and cannot
//! draw.
//!
//! # Why the fourth cell exists
//!
//! An Apple host can reach its GPU natively through Metal or through MoltenVK,
//! and those two paths translate the guest's command stream by completely
//! different means. When a frame is wrong, "is this a metal2vulkan defect or a
//! defect in this device" is the first question and it was previously
//! unanswerable without rebuilding — which changes the binary, the caches and
//! the boot. A binary carrying both rails answers it by running the *same guest
//! stream* twice with one variable changed.
//!
//! # What that costs the rest of the crate
//!
//! `cfg` may only ever answer **"what did this build compile"**. It may not
//! answer "which rail is running", because on this fourth cell those are
//! different questions and the compiler cannot tell them apart — a
//! `not(feature = "backend-vulkan")` block meaning "the Metal arm" simply
//! disappears, silently, the moment both features are on. Everything the
//! running rail decides goes through [`backend::Backend`], whose implementation
//! the process picks once in [`backend::select`]; the `cfg`s that remain are
//! module declarations and the arms of that one selection.
//!
//! Do not reintroduce `not(feature = "backend-vulkan")` as a spelling of "the
//! Metal arm". It says what the build is *not*, which stopped being equivalent
//! the moment this cell existed.
